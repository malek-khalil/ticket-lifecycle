<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
STEP 1 : A critical issue has been reported in the Accounting department where two users are unable to access the new Adobe software, preventing them from opening essential files and performing crucial tasks. The affected users have attempted to restart the application, but the problem persists, significantly impacting their daily operations. The IT team has prioritized this issue and is focusing on updating the Adobe software to the latest version to resolve the file access problem.

STEP 2 : To log into the administrator page using the agent account Cori, open your web browser, navigate to the ticketing system's login page, and enter Cori's credentials. Once logged in, locate the ticket for the Accounting department regarding the Adobe software issue and verify that it is marked as "Sev-C," assigned to the "Support" department, and correctly assigned to Cori. Ensure all details, including the Service Level Agreement (SLA), are accurate and document any necessary changes in the ticket notes for future reference. The underlined are the important things that need to be set so anyone can see those important details.

</p>

<p>
STEP 3 : 
Cori was assigned as the agent to assist customers experiencing issues accessing the Adobe software. During the call, Cori advised the users to restart their computers as a potential solution. After lunch, the customers called back to inform Cori that the restart was successful and they were now able to access Adobe without any problems. Cori left notes so that anyone can see this after and will be able to see how this issue was resolved. Cori then closed this issue and left another note on how it was solved.
